## Introduction ##
This Postman Collection aids in integrating [Nuvei](https://docs.nuvei.com/documentation/home/) into the Open Payment Framework (OPF).

The integration supports:

* Authorize card using Hosted Payment Page
* Settlement
* Refund
* Reversal
* Reauthorization

**Note**:
You need to contact your account manager at Nuvei to have IP Address made optional in the case of Reauthorization since the IP Address is not mandatory during the subsequent MIT process.


### In summary ###
In summary, to import the [Postman Collection](mapping_configuration.json), this page will guide you through the following steps:

a) Create your Nuvei test account.

b) Create a Nuvei payment integration in OPF.

c) Get the credentials for your Nuvei integration.

d) Prepare the [Postman Environment](environment_configuration.json) file so the collection can be imported with all your OPF Tenant and Nuvei Test Account unique values. 

### Creating a Nuvei Account ###
Create your Nuvei test account by writing mail to: integration-international@nuvei.com
On production you will have someone set as an admin who will be able to create accounts for others.

### Creating a Nuvei Payment Integration ###
Create a Nuvei payment integration in the OPF workbench. For reference, see [Creating Payment Integration
](https://help.sap.com/docs/OPEN_PAYMENT_FRAMEWORK/3580ff1b17144b8780c055bbb7c2bed3/20a64f954df1425391757759011e7e6b.html).

### Get the credentials for your Nuvei integration ###

You will find the credentials after logging in [Nuvei test account](https://sandbox.nuvei.com/)
The MerchantID siteID and secret Key are under Settings -> My Integrations Settings.

### Preparing the Postman environment_configuration file ###

**1. Token**

Get your access token by [creating an external app](https://help.sap.com/docs/OPEN_PAYMENT_FRAMEWORK/8ccca5bb539a49258e924b467ee4e1c2/d927d21974fe4b368e063f72733bf0fe.html) and [making authorized API calls](https://help.sap.com/docs/OPEN_PAYMENT_FRAMEWORK/8ccca5bb539a49258e924b467ee4e1c2/40c792e66e2942209dc853a43533d78d.html).

Copy the value of the access_token field (it’s a JWT) and set as the ``token`` value in the environment file.

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure the value is prefixed with **Bearer**. e.g. ``Bearer {{token}}``.

**2. Root url**

The ``rootUrl`` is the **BASE URL** of your OPF tenant.

E.g. if your OPF workbench url was this …

<https://opf-iss-d0.uis.commerce.stage.context.cloud.sap/opf-workbench>.

The base Url would be

https://opf-iss-d0.uis.commerce.stage.context.cloud.sap.


**3. Integration ID and Configuration ID**

The ``integrationId`` and ``configurationId`` values identify the payment integration and payment configuration, which can be found in the top left of your **Configuration Details** page in the OPF workbench.

* ``integrationId`` maps to ``accountGroupId`` in Postman
* ``configurationId`` maps to ``accountId`` in Postman

**4. merchantID and siteID**

You have already obtained those IDs from the Nuvei backoffice.(under Settings -> My Integrations Settings.)

**5. secretKey**

The same place that you find the merchantId, you need to click the "Reveal" button to get the secret Key.

**6. apiEnv**

``secure.safecharge.com`` for production script element

``ppp-test.nuvei.com`` for sandbox script element


### Allowlist
Add the following domains to the domain allowlist in OPF workbench. For instructions, see [Adding Tenant-specific Domain to Allowlist
](https://help.sap.com/docs/OPEN_PAYMENT_FRAMEWORK/3580ff1b17144b8780c055bbb7c2bed3/a6836485b4494cfaad4033b4ee7a9c64.html).


``safecharge.com`` for production account

``nuvei.com``and ``safecharge.com`` for test account
