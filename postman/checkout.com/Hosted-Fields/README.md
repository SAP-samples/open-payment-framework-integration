## Introduction ##
This Postman Collection aids in integrating [Checkout.com Payment gateway](https://www.checkout.com/docs) into the Open Payment Framework (OPF).

The integration supports:

* Authorize card using Hosted Fields (Frames)
* Settlement - Delayed Capture Pattern
* Refund
* Reversal
* Reauthorization
* Notifications - Authorization


### In summary ###
In summary, to import the [Postman Collection](mapping_configuration.json), this page will guide you through the following steps:

a) Create your checkout.com test account.

b) Create a checkout.com payment integration in OPF workbench.

c) Set up your checkout.com test account to work with OPF.

d) Prepare the [Postman Environment](environment_configuration.json) file so the collection can be imported with all your OPF Tenant and checkout.com Test Account unique values. 

### Creating a checkout.com Account ###
You can sign up for a free checkout.com test account at https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account.


### Creating a checkout.com Payment Integration ###
Create a checkout.com payment integration in the OPF workbench. For reference, see [Creating Payment Integration
](https://help.sap.com/docs/OPEN_PAYMENT_FRAMEWORK/3580ff1b17144b8780c055bbb7c2bed3/20a64f954df1425391757759011e7e6b.html).


### Setting up Your checkout.com Test Account to work with OPF ###
Once you have created you checkout.com test account,do the following to set it up to work with OPF:
1. **Please refer to this [API keys](https://www.checkout.com/docs/developer-resources/api/manage-api-keys/api-keys) document to create your public key and secret key.**

   **public key** is used for client-side authentication,here we use it as **merchantID** in OPF.
   
   **secret key** is used for server-to-server authentication and is supported across most of our endpoints.

2. **Webhook for notification**

   **There are two ways to create a workflow to start receiving webhook notifications:**

   ***a. can use checkout.com [Workflows API](https://www.checkout.com/docs/developer-resources/webhooks/manage-webhooks#Add_a_new_workflow)*** to create a workflow by specifying both the events you would like to subscribe to and the necessary configurations for the webhook workflow action.

   ***b. can use the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.checkout.com/) create a webhook workflow, you can refer [Create a webhook](https://www.checkout.com/docs/business-operations/use-the-dashboard/developers/webhooks#Create_a_webhook)***

   **Note**:
   1. When you create webhook via API, remember put the "Authorization" with Secret key value in the header.

   2. The URL address in both ways is fetched from our OPF workbench: Notification URL.


### Preparing the Postman environment_configuration file ###

**1. Token**

Get your access token by [creating an external app](https://help.sap.com/docs/OPEN_PAYMENT_FRAMEWORK/8ccca5bb539a49258e924b467ee4e1c2/d927d21974fe4b368e063f72733bf0fe.html) and [making authorized API calls](https://help.sap.com/docs/OPEN_PAYMENT_FRAMEWORK/8ccca5bb539a49258e924b467ee4e1c2/40c792e66e2942209dc853a43533d78d.html).

Copy the value of the access_token field (it’s a JWT) and set as the ``token`` value in the environment file.

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure the value is prefixed with **Bearer**. e.g. ``Bearer {{token}}``.

**2. Root url**

The ``rootUrl`` is the **BASE URL** of your OPF tenant.

E.g. if your workbench/OPF cockpit url was this …

<https://opf-iss-d0.uis.commerce.stage.context.cloud.sap/opf-workbench>.

The base Url would be

https://opf-iss-d0.uis.commerce.stage.context.cloud.sap.


**3. Integration ID and Configuration ID**

The ``integrationId`` and ``configurationId`` values identify the payment integration and payment configuration, which can be found in the top left of your **Configuration Details** page in the OPF workbench.

* ``integrationId`` maps to ``accountGroupId`` in postman
* ``configurationId`` maps to ``accountId`` in postman

**4. authentication_outbound_api_key_value_export_172**

The value of this Variable is the **Secret (or Private) Key** which you have done in dashboard of checkout.com. If you haven't completed this step, please go to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.checkout.com/) to create the value. In Test environment, it starts with **sk_sbox**.

* Set Secret key prefixed with **Bearer** as **value** for environment variable  ``authentication_outbound_api_key_value_export_172``.


**5. apiKey**

The value of API key is the ``public key`` which you obtained in dashboard of checkout.com. If you haven't completed this step, please go to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.checkout.com/) to create the value. In Test environment, it starts with **pk_sbox**.

Replace the ``apiKey`` variable value in the environment file with this value starting with **pk_sbox**.

**6. authentication_outbound_api_key_value_export_362**

The value of authentication_outbound_api_key_value_export_36 is the ``public key``, which is used for Google Pay. (This is the Quick Buy feature in OPF.)

**Note**:
You must be signed in as a Google Developer to do this. More information in [Checkout.com](https://www.checkout.com/docs/payments/add-payment-methods/google-pay#Step_1:_Integrate_with_Google_Pay) 

**7. Variables for applePay**

The variables starting with ``applePay`` are also for the Quick Buy feature in OPF. By default, you can keep these items unchanged and ensure they are unselected in your Postman collection.

**Note**:
If you want to enable this function, you must have an Apple Developer account. More information in [Checkout.com](https://www.checkout.com/docs/payments/add-payment-methods/apple-pay)



**8. processing_channel_id**
This parameter is requested during payment flow
To find the ``processing_channel_id`` in the  [Dashboard](https://dashboard.checkout.com/):
1. Login to the Dashboard.
2. Go to the **Developers** tab.
3. Open the **Keys** page.
4. Either use the button to Create a new key or edit one of the existing keys.

You will see a list of the processing channels with their corresponding IDs when you access the key details.
