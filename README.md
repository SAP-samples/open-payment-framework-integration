# SAP Commerce Cloud, Open Payment Framework

## Overview

This repository provides **working examples of pre-built integrations** for payment gateways and payment methods, delivered as Postman Collections and storefront setup samples. Leverage these resources within your SAP Commerce Cloud, Open Payment Framework tenant to streamline integration.

**Key Features**  
- **Freedom of Choice**: Our support for Payment Service Providers (PSPs) goes beyond the examples listed, offering a broader range of choices and integrations, ensuring freedom in selecting the payment solutions that best fit your needs.  
- **Customization**: Configure your own payment gateways to integrate with any PSP, and enable the specific payment methods (e.g., credit cards, digital wallets) they support. Additionally, we support the configuration of standalone payment methods, allowing you to incorporate unique or specialized payment options tailored to your business requirements.

**Important Notes**  
- The provided samples are **reference implementations** for select PSPs and are **not officially supported** by SAP or payment providers.  
- **Thoroughly test integrations** in your OPF tenant before deploying to production.  
- Adapt the templates or build custom integrations to meet your unique business requirements.
